# 🚀 BlueMe Production Deployment Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The production deployment at `blueme.app` has the following issues:
1. **API routes returning HTML instead of JSON** (404 errors for `/api/convert-youtube`)
2. **CSS files being served with wrong MIME type** (`text/html` instead of `text/css`)
3. **Playlist API returning HTML instead of JSON**

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

You have a **hybrid deployment setup**:
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify at `blueme.app` (static files only)
- **Backend**: Should be deployed on Railway (API server)

The issue is that the backend isn't properly deployed or connected, so Netlify is serving static files and redirecting all routes to `index.html`.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Updated Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`)
- Added API proxy to forward `/api/*` requests to Railway backend
- Fixed MIME types for CSS, JS, and JSON files
- Proper static file serving configuration

### 2. **Updated Railway Configuration** (`railway.toml`)
- Enhanced deployment configuration
- Added health check endpoint
- Proper environment variables

### 3. **Created Environment Template** (`env.example`)
- Complete environment variable template
- Production-ready configuration

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway**

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign in with GitHub**
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your `blueme` repository**
6. **Set environment variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
   SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://blueme.app
   ```
7. **Deploy!**

### **Step 2: Update Netlify Configuration**

The `netlify.toml` has been updated with:
- API proxy to your Railway backend URL
- Correct MIME types for static files
- Proper redirect rules

**Important**: Update the Railway URL in `netlify.toml` line 11:
```toml
to = "https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api/:splat"
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy Frontend**

1. **Commit and push changes to GitHub**
2. **Netlify will auto-deploy** the updated configuration
3. **Test the API endpoints**

## 🧪 **Testing**

After deployment, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://blueme.app/api/health

# Playlists
curl https://blueme.app/api/playlists

# YouTube conversion
curl -X POST https://blueme.app/api/convert-youtube \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://youtu.be/s35PCxWIh9Q","format":"mp3","quality":"192"}'
```

## 🔍 **Expected Results**

- ✅ API endpoints return JSON instead of HTML
- ✅ CSS files load with correct MIME type
- ✅ YouTube conversion works
- ✅ Playlist management works
- ✅ Authentication system works

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist**

1. **Check Railway deployment logs**
2. **Verify environment variables are set**
3. **Test Railway backend directly** (not through Netlify proxy)
4. **Check Netlify function logs**
5. **Verify CORS configuration**

## 📞 **Support**

If you need help with the deployment:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify all environment variables
3. Test backend URL directly
4. Check Netlify redirect logs

---

**Your BlueMe app will be fully functional once the backend is deployed to Railway!** 🎵✨
